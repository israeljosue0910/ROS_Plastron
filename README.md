### **Robotics Operating System**
---
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. 

### **About**
---
ROS_Plastron is a language that aims to make the Robotic Operating System more accessible for users who have no previous programming experience. Its main features allow users to start their robotics project with basic ROS Node templates that they can modify to their needs, as well as manipulating their existing ROS Nodes.

### **Language Features**
---
The Node Creation feature allows users to generatee four type of node templates: Subscribers, Publishers, Clients and Servers. The Existing Node Manipulation feature allows users to load existing node files into the system, perform changes to it and then generate the node file. In the future ROS_Plastron will support other features like: Custom Message Creation and URDF Files Creation.
